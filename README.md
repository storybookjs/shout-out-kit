# Shout-out Generator Kit

A shout-out image generation API template.

It generates an image with a thank you message and a contour background. Each contour is unique and derived from the username.

## Architecture

The whole thing is powered by an image generation API. The shout-out image is implemented as a React component. A Netlify Functions handles the requests, spins-up a headless browser with Playwright to screenshot the DOM ðŸ“¸ And returns an image.

It's a pared back version of Christopher Biscardi's wonderful [Building an OpenGraph image generation API](https://egghead.io/playlists/building-an-opengraph-image-generation-api-with-cloudinary-netlify-functions-and-react-914e) course.

The build setup is configured via the `Makefile`.
